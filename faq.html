    <div class="container">
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>üìã Visa Application Process</h2>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q1: How long does it take to obtain a Japanese work visa?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Processing usually takes 1‚Äì3 months from submission to approval. It may take longer during busy periods or if additional documents are requested. The timeline depends on both the employer's preparation and the immigration office's workload. Early application is advised.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q2: What is the Highly Skilled Professional Point System?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: It's a system that grants points for education, work experience, and income. Applicants with 70 points or more can obtain the "Highly Skilled Professional Visa," which offers benefits such as fast-track permanent residency and broader work rights for family members.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q3: What is the capital requirement for a Business Manager Visa?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Generally, at least 5 million yen is required as paid-in capital. The amount can be shared by multiple investors. However, immigration authorities also review office contracts, business plans, and real operations. Paper-only companies are rarely approved.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q4: What are the requirements for a Dependent (Family Stay) Visa?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: This visa is for family members of foreign residents working or studying legally in Japan. The sponsor must have sufficient income. Marriage or birth certificates are required. Dependents cannot work full-time but may apply for part-time work permission.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q5: What documents are required for a visa application?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Requirements vary by visa type, but generally include a passport, photo, application form, employment contract, educational certificates, and company documents. Missing or inconsistent documents can delay approval, so professional review is recommended.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q6: What is a Certificate of Eligibility (COE)?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: It's a pre-approval document issued by Japanese immigration, confirming the applicant's eligibility for a visa. Typically, the employer or school in Japan applies for it. Once issued, the applicant obtains a visa at a Japanese embassy or consulate abroad.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q7: What is the difference between Permanent and Long-Term Resident visas?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: A Permanent Resident Visa allows unlimited stay and work, usually after 10 years in Japan. A Long-Term Resident Visa is granted based on specific circumstances (e.g., Nikkei descent, divorce from a Japanese spouse) and is renewable every 1‚Äì5 years.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q8: Can I change my visa from Student to Work Visa?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Yes. After graduation, if you have a job offer from a Japanese company and the position matches your field of study, you can apply for a status change. The application requires a contract, company profile, and degree certificate. Review takes 1‚Äì2 months.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q9: When can I renew my visa?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: You can apply for renewal up to 3 months before your current visa expires. It's advisable to renew early to avoid overstaying. If there are changes in your job, marital status, or address, report them at the same time. Timely renewal is essential.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q10: What should I do if my visa application is denied?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: You can reapply. First, confirm the reason for rejection at the immigration office. Prepare improved documentation and explanation. Submitting additional evidence or corrections increases the approval chance. Expert consultation is strongly advised.</div></div>

            <h2>üè¢ Company Formation</h2>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q1: What's the difference between a K.K. (Kabushiki Kaisha) and G.K. (Godo Kaisha)?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: A Kabushiki Kaisha (K.K.) raises funds via stocks and allows for the separation of ownership and management; it has high social credibility. A Godo Kaisha (G.K.) has owners who are also managers and offers high flexibility in profit distribution and operations. A G.K. costs about ¬•140,000 less to establish.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q2: How much does it cost to establish a company?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: A K.K. requires a minimum of approx. ¬•200,000 in actual costs (articles of incorporation notarization, registration tax). A G.K. costs about ¬•60,000. In addition, professional fees (e.g., to an Administrative Scrivener) of around ¬•100,000-¬•150,000 are typically required.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q3: Can foreigners establish a company in Japan?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Yes. There are no restrictions on foreigners establishing a company or becoming a representative director (president). However, if you are a non-resident of Japan, having at least one Japan-based collaborator (e.g., co-founder) will make the process much smoother.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q4: How much capital is required?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Legally, establishing a company from ¬•1 is possible, but it is not realistic. To obtain the "Business Manager" visa, a capital of ¬•5 million (or hiring 2+ full-time staff) is the standard. Considering credibility and initial costs, over ¬•1 million is recommended.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q5: What is the general process for incorporation?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: 1. Decide basic company info (Name, Address, Business Purpose). 2. Create/Notarize Articles of Incorporation (K.K. only). 3. Pay in the capital. 4. Prepare registration documents. 5. File the registration at the Legal Affairs Bureau (this becomes the founding date). 6. Registration complete / File various post-incorporation notifications.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q6: Do I need a "Business Manager" visa to run a company?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: If you actively manage a company in Japan, you generally need a "Business Manager" visa. Key requirements for this visa include: ¬•5 million or more in capital (or 2+ full-time staff), a clear business plan, and an independent, physical office space in Japan.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q7: Is it difficult for foreigners to open a corporate bank account?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Yes, it has become difficult in recent years. Screening is strict, especially for foreign representatives of newly established companies. The clarity of the business plan, the reality of the office space, and the representative's Japanese ability are reviewed. Professional support is recommended.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q8: Do I need a physical office address to register?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Yes, this is essential. A Japanese address is required for registration. For the "Business Manager" visa, you need an independent physical space (not just a virtual address) where business is actually conducted. A home office may be possible under certain strict conditions.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q9: How long does it take to establish the company?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: After all documents are fully prepared, the registration review at the Legal Affairs Bureau usually takes 1-2 weeks. However, including all preparation (articles of incorporation, capital preparation, acquiring personal seal certificates for non-residents, etc.), it is safe to budget 1-2 months.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Q10: What documents do I (as a foreigner) need to prepare?</div><div class="faq-answer">A: Japan residents need their "Seal Certificate" (Inkan Shomeisho) and a registered seal (Jitsuin). Non-residents will need a "Signature Certificate" notarized by a notary public in their home country as a substitute. You will also need a personal bank account in Japan for the capital injection.</div></div>
